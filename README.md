# Mac Natural vs Inverted Scrolling Direction for Trackpad and Mouse
Made for people who use natural scroll direction for trackpad and inverted scrolling direction using a mouse. MacOS currently thinks they are connected and is very annoying to switch back and forth! This AppleScript file is a one click way to switch with ease back and forth. The program recognizes if you have a mouse connected and changes the scroll direction accordingly. 

# Usage
1. Input the name of your mouse on **line 44***
2. Export to application. 
3. Run whenever you want to make the necessary changes

*Find the name of your mouse by typing `system_profiler SPUSBDataType` or `system_profiler spbluetoothdatatype` in terminal
