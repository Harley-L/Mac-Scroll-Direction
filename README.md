# Mac-Scroll-Direction
Made for people who use natural scroll direction for trackpad and non-natural scrolling direction using a mouse. MacOS currently thinks they are connected and is very annoying to switch back and forth! This AppleScript file is a one click way to swtich with ease back and forth. The program recognizes if you have a mouse connected and changes the scroll direction accordingly. 

# Usage
1. Input the name of your mouse on **line 44**.
2. Export to application. 
3. Run whenever you want to make the neccecary changes
